# Background of this project

I used this project to experiment with generating emails with NodeJS and React. I got some help from a friend to do the basic setup of the project as I'm new to React. I did have prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript which helped a lot. Then I proceeded and implemented an email template based on an email that I received from Klarna in September when I paid a purchase at Afound.

The templates are made with React components and NodeJS is used as a server to run the simple React application. This application can be used to generate emails from these templates (into HTML/CSS).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [Postonents library for generating emails with React](https://github.com/Saifadin/postonents)
