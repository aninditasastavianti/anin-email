# What is this project?

This project is an experiment to learn about how to generate emails with NodeJS and React. The templates are made with React components and NodeJS is used as a server to run the simple React application. This application can be used to generate emails from these templates (into HTML/CSS).

As an example, I implemented an email template that I received from Klarna when I paid a purchase with Afound.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the [Postonents library for generating emails with React](https://github.com/Saifadin/postonents)
